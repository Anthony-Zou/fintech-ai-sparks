## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**🚨 "Error submitting order: 'str' object has no attribute 'order_id'"**

- ✅ **Fixed in latest version** - This issue has been resolved
- If you encounter this, ensure you're using the latest code

**📡 Yahoo Finance API Errors**

- **Problem**: "No price data found" or connection timeouts
- **Solution**: Enable "Use Mock Data" in the Data Source Control panel
- **Alternative**: Check internet connection and try different symbols

**💰 Orders Not Executing**

- **Problem**: Limit orders remain pending
- **Solution**: Check if limit price is reasonable relative to market price
- **For Market Orders**: Ensure market data is available for the symbol

**📊 Charts Not Loading**

- **Problem**: Empty or missing price charts
- **Solution**: Wait for market data to load, or switch to mock data
- **Check**: Ensure symbols are properly initialized

**📖 Order Books Page Shows "No Bids/No Asks"**

- **Expected Behavior**: Empty order books are normal when no limit orders have been submitted
- **Solution**: Submit limit orders (not market orders) to populate the order book:
  1. Navigate to "Market Data" tab → "Order Submission"
  2. Create a BUY limit order below current market price
  3. Create a SELL limit order above current market price
  4. Check "Order Book" tab - you should now see bids and asks
- **Verification**:
  - Market orders execute immediately and don't stay in the book
  - Only pending limit orders appear in the order book
  - Use the diagnostic script: `python3 diagnose_order_books.py`

**🔄 Order Books Page Not Updating**

- **Problem**: Order book shows stale data or doesn't refresh
- **Solution**:
  - Refresh the browser page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
  - Clear browser cache and restart Streamlit
  - Ensure system is properly initialized before viewing order books
- **Check**: Look for "Initialize the system to view order books" message

**🐳 Docker Issues**

```bash
# If container won't start
docker logs <container-id>

# Rebuild with no cache
docker build -t algo-trading-platform . --no-cache

# Run with port mapping
docker run -p 8501:8501 algo-trading-platform
```

**🔧 Installation Issues**

```bash
# If requirements installation fails
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall

# For specific dependency conflicts
pip install streamlit==1.28.0 yfinance==0.2.18 --force-reinstall
```

### Performance Tips

- **Large Symbol Lists**: Start with 3-5 symbols to avoid API rate limits
- **Mock Data**: Use mock data for testing and development to avoid API delays
- **Strategy Parameters**: Start with conservative momentum thresholds (0.02-0.05)
- **Browser Performance**: Use Chrome or Firefox for best Streamlit performance

### Getting Help

1. **Check Logs**: Monitor the terminal/console for detailed error messages
2. **Test Components**: Use the test files in `tests/` directory to verify functionality
3. **Simplified Setup**: Try minimal configuration first (1 symbol, mock data)
4. **Documentation**: Review the detailed [End-to-End Use Case](#-end-to-end-use-case-complete-trading-workflow) for step-by-step guidance
