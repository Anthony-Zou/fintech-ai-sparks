üéØ **Understanding Order Books**

The Order Books page shows pending limit orders waiting to be executed:

üìà **Bids (Buy Orders)**: Orders to buy at or below a specific price
üìâ **Asks (Sell Orders)**: Orders to sell at or above a specific price

üîß **How to Populate Order Books**:

1. Go to "Market Data" ‚Üí "Order Submission"
2. Submit LIMIT orders (not MARKET orders)
3. BUY limits below current price appear in Bids
4. SELL limits above current price appear in Asks
5. Return to Order Books to see the results

‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Misunderstandings**:

‚Ä¢ Market orders execute immediately and don't appear in order books
‚Ä¢ Only pending limit orders are shown
‚Ä¢ Empty order books are normal when no limits are active
‚Ä¢ Orders may execute if they cross the spread

üí° **Troubleshooting**:

‚Ä¢ If orders don't appear: Check they are LIMIT orders
‚Ä¢ If wrong section: Verify BUY/SELL selection
‚Ä¢ If page seems broken: Try refreshing browser
‚Ä¢ If persistent issues: Initialize system again
